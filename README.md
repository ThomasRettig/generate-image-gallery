# Image Gallery
This is a simple Bash script to generate an HTML file containing images in the project folder.

## Get started
Ensure that you are either on a _Unix environment_ or in the _Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)_

Then, execute the Bash script:
```bash
./gen
```

## How it works
The Bash script will search for `.jpg` images in the existing directory, and then generate an HTML file containing these images. Visit `index.html` to view the generated file.
